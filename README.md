This application is used for converting the input video file to grya scale

I have deployed the model on heroku platform You can run this on your local machine by using https://grayscale-api.herokuapp.com/
Required gray scale file will be mailed on your specified google account

I have used openCV to do so

Folowing are the steps that i followed

extracted all the frames from a provided video file
gray scale all the frames
finally merged all the frames to a video again
