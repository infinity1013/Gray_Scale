This application is used for converting the input video file to gray scale

I have deployed the model on heroku platform.
You can run this on your local machine by using https://grayscale-api.herokuapp.com/
Required gray scale file will be mailed on your specified google account

I have used openCV to do so

Following are the steps that i followed
1) extracted all the frames from a provided video file
2) Gray scaled all the frames
3) finally merged all the frames to a video again
